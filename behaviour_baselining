# Behavioural Baselining & Anomaly Detection
# ------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# Establish normal behaviour profiles for users,
# services, and workloads, and detect deviations
# indicative of potential security threats.

# Baseline Construction Phase
FOR each entity (user, service, workload):
    collect historical security events
    derive normal behaviour profile
    store baseline model

# Real-Time Detection Phase
FOR each new security_event:
    entity = extract entity from event
    baseline = retrieve baseline model for entity

    deviation = compare event to baseline

    IF deviation > baseline_threshold:
        flag event as anomalous
        forward event for risk scoring
